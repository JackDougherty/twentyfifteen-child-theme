# twentyfifteen-child-theme
The WordPress TwentyFifteen base theme is responsive across devices, with vertical menus to organize large amounts of content for my academic courses and projects. This child theme offers two modifications:

- sidebar menu positioned on the right side of primary content
- author byline and date at the top of posts/pages, not the bottom
