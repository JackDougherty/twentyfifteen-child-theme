# twentyfifteen-child-theme
The WordPress Twenty Fifteen base theme is responsive across devices, with vertical menus to organize large amounts of content for my academic courses and projects. I created this child theme to modify the following:

- sidebar menu positioned on the right side of primary content
- author byline and date at the top of posts/pages, not bottom
- submenu items are displayed whenever the parent/sibling page is active, not just when down-arrow is clicked

Note that TwentyFifteen base theme does *not* display the admin's name at either top or bottom of the post, until another author creates a post (thereby making it a multi-author blog), and then all posts will have bylines. The same principle holds true for pages: no byline will appear until another author/editor/admin creates a page, then all existing pages will have bylines.
