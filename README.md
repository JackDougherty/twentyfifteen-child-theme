# twentyfifteen-child-theme
The WordPress TwentyFifteen base theme is responsive across devices, with vertical menus to organize large amounts of content for my academic courses and projects. This child theme offers two modifications:

- sidebar menu positioned on the right side of primary content
- author byline and date at the top of posts/pages, not bottom

Note that TwentyFifteen base theme does *not* display the admin's name at either top or bottom of the post, until another author creates a post (thereby making it a multi-author blog), and then all posts will have bylines. The same principle holds true for pages: no byline will appear until another author/editor/admin creates a page, then all existing pages will have bylines.
